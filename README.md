## ROBOT DESIGN ðŸš€


Hello there! This is my repository for the Class Robot_design. The main objective of this class was to learn and apply both Dynamics and Controllers for both Dual Link manipulator and Differential Robot in ROS. 

Take into consideration that part of the class was to actually work with an ABB Robot and I apply a Computer Vision algorithm for an inspection process. This Computer vision algorithm is independent from the ROS project. 

Note that this project was done in ROS1 Noetic.
